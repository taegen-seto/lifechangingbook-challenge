      Synopsis:
      <p>
        The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is
        simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white
        striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of
        breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des RÃªves, and it is
        only open at night.
        <br />
        But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underwayâ€”a duel between
        two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since
        childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors.
        Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left
        standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of
        imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco
        tumble headfirst into loveâ€”a deep, magical love that makes the lights
        flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.
        <br />
        True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone
        involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus perÂ­formers to the
        patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring
        acrobats overhead.
